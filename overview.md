**Ops Stack: Smarter Back-office Today, AI-ready for Tomorrow.**

# What is Ops Stack?

Ops Stack is an integrated platform designed to modernize securities back-office operations—clearing, settlement, reconciliation, fails management, reference data, and reporting—into a single, cohesive ecosystem. It unifies data, workflows, and reporting across multiple engines while remaining extensible for future AI/ML use cases.

Early Integrations – Ops Stack is connecting with existing bank tools and systems to fit seamlessly into daily operations.

Active Pilots – Teams are testing AI use cases to uncover where Ops Stack adds the most value for operations

# Where We’re Going

Full Lifecycle Coverage – Expanding to cover the entire trade lifecycle from order capture to settlement.

AI-Powered Insights – Preparing data so forecasting, anomaly detection, and risk modeling can be applied.

Bank-Wide Integration – Strengthening links with other systems and apps in the Bank including integrations with eTask, Quartz and more

User Empowerment – Making configuration and reporting more self-service, reducing dependence on tech

Ops Stack is evolving into one platform that streamlines securities operations and readies them for tomorrow, and your feedback will help shape the journey.
